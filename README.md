## About the stack

This project uses the T3 stack

- Tailwind
- tRPC
- TypeScript

In addition, it includes user authentication, which is handled by Next (Next-auth)

Obviously, CRUD Operations are a big deal for this application. All of this is taken care of with Prisma and Zod (validation)

## Notes

This project is in development and is yet to be concluded. It will soon be available on Vercel.
